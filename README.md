# RISCVy-BSDness
The stepping stones on my journey to porting software to OpenBSD on RISC-V and security research in that environment.
I'm also interested in writing Linux kernel drivers for RISC-V, which as time goes on may actually end up happening 
before I'm ready to submit those kinds of contributions to OpenBSD. 

My end goal is to have the skills to build a RISC-V mobo that fits in eithr an old Thinkpad or one'a them fancy newfangled Frameworks, but that's too much cart before the ponies right now.

## On the beaten path
### Knowledge (which is power)
Fun C Review course and light project. Would not reccomend as a starting point for learning C - https://lowlevel.academy/courses
Starting point for OpenBSD driver Development - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5qhWw07qpU&t=384s
"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson - https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm

### Hardware (Toys!)
What will probably end up being my first bare metal desktop dev environment - https://www.starfivetech.com/en/site/boards
Intent is to swap the 1 GHz/1Gb RAM with the more powerful Milk-V Mars CM using a CM4 adaptor. Backup Plan is to port useful command line software to the R-01 for a neat cyberdeck network client, and maybe some light retro gaming. - https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole



// TODO add a buymeacoffee link and other passive begging solutions to fund/subsidize hardware.
